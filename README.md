# Instructions to run the code

1. Make a clone of the GitHub repositary in your local computer.
2. Load the folder in any code editor.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the project in local server using `npm start`.


# Dependencies used in the project

1. `react-redux` and `@reduxjs/toolkit` to integrate Redux.
2. `react-router-dom` for navigation using paths.
3. `react-google-maps` to integrate Google Maps.
4. `react-spinners` to use loading spinners.
5. `react-custom-scrollbars` to use custom scrollbars.
6. `react-icons` to use icons.
7. `gh-pages` to deploy the application on GitHub.


# Points to consider

1. I have done the complete integration of Google Maps in the application but commented out the code as it needed billing to use the APIs.
2. Have implemented the application using Redux and LocalStorage as well. Preferred LocalStorage in the final build as the data would persist.
